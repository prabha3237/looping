The environmental eco club has discovered a new Amoeba that grows in the order of a Fibonacci series every month. They are exhibiting their amoeba in a national conference. They want to know the size of the amoeba at a particular time instant. If a particular month’s index is given, write a  program to displays the amoeba’s size……???. For Example, The size of the amoeba on month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..will be 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 respectively.
Input format:
The first input containing an integer which denotes the number of the month
Output format:
Print the amoeba size.
Refer the sample output for formatting.

def fibonacci_size(month):
    if month <= 0:
        return 0
    elif month == 1:
        return 0
    elif month == 2:
        return 1

    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, month):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b
month_index = int(input("Enter the month index: "))
amoeba_size = fibonacci_size(month_index)
print(f"The size of the amoeba on month {month_index} is: {amoeba_size}")
..
Enter the month index: 7
The size of the amoeba on month 7 is: 8
